        Squeak squeak! Hey hooman, it's your guinea pig here! It's getting warm, and us piggies don't do well with heat. So, let me share some ways we like to stay cool. Wheek wheek! Listen up!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Frozen water bottle fun!</strong> – Fill a water bottle with cold water or freeze it, and place it near us. We love snuggling up against it when it gets too warm. Squeak!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Shady spots, please!</strong> – Keep our cage out of the sun, hooman. We need cool, shady spots where the sun won't turn us into roast piggies. Wheek wheek!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Cooling tiles, wheek!</strong> – Lay down some cool ceramic tiles in our enclosure. They feel so nice on our little feet and bellies. Squeaky bliss!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Ice cube snacks!</strong> – Pop a few ice cubes into our water dish. It's so refreshing, and we can even nibble on them a little. Squeaky excitement!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Light breeze, hooman!</strong> – A gentle fan (not too close!) can help move the air around. We love feeling the cool breeze without it blowing too hard. Squeak squeak!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Damp cloths, wheek!</strong> – You can dampen a cloth with cool water and place it in our cage. We love to sit on it or under it when it gets too hot. Squeaky cool!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Fresh veggies!</strong> – Give us watery treats like cucumbers or lettuce, hooman! It helps keep us hydrated and cool at the same time. Nom nom, squeak!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>No heavy blankets!</strong> – Keep those heavy fleeces away in summer, please! We need light bedding to stay cool. Wheek wheek!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Keep our water cold!</strong> – Refresh our water bottle often with cold water. Nothing beats a cool sip when we’re hot. Squeak slurp!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-4">
        <strong>Cool baths, but only sometimes!</strong> – If we’re really hot, you can give us a light, cool (not cold!) sponge bath. But be gentle, hooman, we don’t like too much water! Wheek wheek!
    </p>

    <p class="text-white text-3xl mt-8">
        There you go! Keep us cool, and we’ll keep squeaking our happy little squeaks! Wheek wheek!
    </p>
